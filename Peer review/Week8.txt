Setup: movie is great
Part 1: Movies are great. You can also include snapshots of density 0.7 and 0.9
Part 2: I did not see the images for the non crystalline and crystalline states. From the video, i could see the crystalline state. You can use point representation.

Setup: movie is great, can also include a movie exported from VMD
Part 1: images are great
Part 2: I couldn't see the png files. The tif files are great

Part 1: Good to include both representation
Part 2: It is difficult to tell the crystallinity at the viewing angle. With point representation, the particle should small enough to see periodic gaps.
