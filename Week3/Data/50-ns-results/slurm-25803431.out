  You are combining position restraints with Parrinello-Rahman pressure

  position restraints with pressure coupling, we suggest to use Berendsen
  pressure coupling instead.

NOTE 2 [file npt.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.

 Average load imbalance: 9.3%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 78%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.3%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.964
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 0.7 %

NOTE: 7.3 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
